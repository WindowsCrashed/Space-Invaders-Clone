# :joystick: Space Invaders Clone Project :joystick:

A clone of the good old Space Invaders, made with Unity from scratch.

The goal isn't really to make an authentic replica of the original,
rather a just accurate enough recreation, within the limitations of my programming and artistic *(sprites...)* skills.

All the sprites and fonts were made from scratch, and the screen size and resolution were estimated based on observation of material found online.

Hope you like the code and enjoy the game once it's complete! :smile:
